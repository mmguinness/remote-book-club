# To Do:

### Not yet finished:

1. Review how books are sorted and displayed by date(in header, should be newest/current book first)
2. Options for selecting/setting a book should remove months that have already been selected.
2. Update password settings - currently you need to log in every time you click suggested books, this should recognise if you are in a session already.
3. Select and delete buttons for suggested books should onyl b visible to an admin user, not all logged in users. 
4. _Suggested by user:_ is currently hardcoded and should be reading the id of user that suggested the book.
5. Integration testing.

### Questions:

1. Is there a better way to display 6 books at a time on the homepage, carousel type display? 
2. Any major security things I should be considering for website when hosted on Heroku?

### New Features:

1. Host website on Heroku and transfer local database to MongoDB Atlas database.
2. Add page which contains a poster/layout of books read so far this year. Inspired by [Reading Lists](http://www.abouttoday.co.uk/Reading-lists) by Lizzy Stewart.
3. Add comments section on the suggested books or a voting system?
4. Add a reminder email to memebers of the book club.
5. Add ability to upload image for bookcover.
